# Project-Non-parametric-statistics
The main objective of this project was using R to implement on various models the MISE(mean integrated square error) to estimate a bandwith using optimization in order to approximate our theoritical density. A side note to this project was also the approximation using cross-validation's method  implemented automatically in R and also implemented by hand.
